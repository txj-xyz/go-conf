# `go-conf` Config Loader

Simple viper wrapper for a config loader, for some of my projects.

You must have a `local.config.yaml` in your project in order to use this config template, it can be extended but this is the required base.

The goal of this is to allow extensible files and production switches.

# Usage

Installing in your project
```shell
go get github.com/txj-xyz/go-conf
```
